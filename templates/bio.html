                    I'm a writer and editor from London, living in Berlin since 2012 (with several years in the US in the middle). I'm currently an editor at Artsy where I commission and edit art coverage. Prior to that, I was a freelance writer â€“ covering mostly art, as well as film, music, tech and other cultural stuff - for the New York Times, The Financial Times, Frieze, WSJ Magazine, and many more. I'm also the author of a book on <a href="https://www.cornerhousepublications.org/publications/german-design/">German design.</a>
 
                   
                     Sometimes, I even remember to send out my own newsletter, <a href="https://josietj.substack.com/">Realisticism</a>. The rest of the time, I'm rollerskating.
