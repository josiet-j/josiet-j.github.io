                    I'm a writer and editor from London. From 2012 until recently, I lived in Berlin, Germany and I am currently in Cambridge,
                    Massachusetts. I write about culture â€“ mostly art, though I also cover film, music, tech and whatever else I find 
                    interesting - for the New York Times, The Financial Times, The Economist, Frieze, WIRED UK, and many more.  
                    I was Online and Associate Editor of Sleek from 2014-5.

                     I am currently working on a book about the relationship between reality, technology and art -
                      also the topic of my newsletter, <a href="https://josietj.substack.com/">Realisticism</a>.
