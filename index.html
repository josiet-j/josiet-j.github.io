        PERFECT typography is more a science than an art. Mastery of the trade is
        indispensable, but it isn't everything. Unerring taste, the hallmark of
        perfection, rests also upon a clear understanding of the laws of harmonious
        design. As a rule, impeccable taste springs partly from inborn sensitivity:
        from feeling. But feelings remain rather unproductive unless they can inspire a
        secure judgment. Feelings have to mature into knowledge about the consequences
        of formal decisions. For this reason, there are no born masters of typography,
        but self- education may lead in time to mastery.
